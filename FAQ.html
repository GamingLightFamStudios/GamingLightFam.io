        <button class="faq-question">What are the common signs that I’ve been hacked?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>If you suspect that you may have been hacked or simply want to know what to look out for, then here are some indicators that your account has been hacked:
            <ul>
                <li><p>You log in to notice that some or all of your rare items have gone missing</p></li>
                <li><p>You have Robux purchases or Gamepass items that you don’t remember purchasing</p></li>
                <li><p>Your account login details have been changed without your permission</p></li>
                </ul>
                If you notice any of these things on your account, it’s best to take precautions to secure your account
            </p>
            </ul>
            <br><br>
            <h1>I’ve been hacked; what do I do?</h1>
            <p>Here are some simple and effective steps that’ll help you regain control of your account and make sure you don't get hacked again</p>
            <br><br>
            <h1>Step 1: Contact Roblox</h1>
            <ul>
                <li><p>If your account has been compromised, contacting Roblox is a vital step to protect your account. Even if you can still access your account, you should contact them regardless, as they can restore your account to secure it and remove any entry points the hacker may have in your account, stopping further access</p></li>
                <li><p>Contacting Roblox also means you will receive an account restoration email response, which our team requires if you want your items returned</p></li>
                <li><p>Head to <a href="https://www.roblox.com/support">Roblox Support</a> and follow these steps</p></li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Fill out the contact information on the form. You should include the Roblox username and email address associated with the hacked account. The email address you fill in should be a connected or a billing one. Roblox cannot verify ownership if the email address is neither of these</p></li>
                <img class="faq-image" src="Assets Image/FAQ/Step 1.png">
                <li><p>In the issue details section, select the device you're using, and under "Type of Help Category", choose "Account Hacked or Can't Log In" on the drop-down menu, followed by "Account Hacked" on the secondary menu</p></li>
                <img class="faq-image" src="Assets Image/FAQ/Step 2.png">
                <br><br>
                <img class="faq-image" src="Assets Image/FAQ/Step 3.png">
                <li><p>You should then focus on writing an accurate description of the issue. You mainly need to let them know your account was compromised and that you would like it restored and secured</p></li>
            </ul>
            <img class="faq-image" src="Assets Image/FAQ/Step 4.png">
            <br>
            <h1>Description of Issue</h1>
            <p>Here is a baseline description that you can use to start
                <br>
                "I have been redirected from GamingLightFam! Support as I need assistance in restoring and securing my hacked account. I was hacked on dd/mm/yyyy. I was hacked by {insert a description of how you were hacked}. The Roblox username of the person who hacked me is {insert Roblox username}. Please help me secure my account."
                <ul>
                    <li><p>You should inform them whether you lost any Robux or Roblox limiteds</p></li>
                    <li><p>You should inform them whether your settings, such as your 2 Factor Authentication, were changed</p></li>
                    <li><p>You should inform them if your age was changed</p></li>
                    <li><p>You should inform them if your email was changed</p></li>
                    <li><p>You should inform them if your password was changed</p></li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <h1>Step 2: Setup a new secure password</h1>
            <p>For information on how to change your password, please visit Roblox's support article <a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313100-How-do-I-change-my-password" target="_blank"> here</a>
            <br><br>
            <h1>Step 3: Enable 2 Step Verification</h1>
           <ul>
            <li><p>Once you’ve set up a new password and logged into your account, enabling 2-Step Verification can be very helpful in securing your account against future threats as it creates an extra layer of protection against password theft. For information on how to enable 2-Step Verification on your account, please see Roblox's support article <a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/212459863-Add-2-Step-Verification-to-Your-Account" target="_blank">here.</a></p></li>
            <li><p>This means that you will either receive an email whenever there is a login to your Roblox account from a new device, with a code you will need to put in to access your account, or you need to enter a code from an authenticator app each time you wish to log in</p></li>
           </ul>
         </p>
            <p>How to prevent being hacked again</p>
            <br><br>
            <h1>Use 2 Step Verification (2SV)</h1>
            <p>Using two-step verification is a very effective way of preventing people from accessing your account without also having access to your email. Please see step 2 above to learn how to enable two-step verification on your Roblox account</p>
            <br><br><br>
            <h1>Keep your details private</h1>
            <p>You should never give out your password to anyone other than your parent or guardian. Be sure never to post your account login information on Roblox or social media. Members of GamingLightFam’s staff team will never ask for your password</p>
            <br><br>
            <h1>Always log out of your Roblox account when you are done playing</h1>
            <p>If you’ve logged into your account on a device that you don’t own, whether it be a school computer or a friend’s tablet, it’s possible that the device still has your login information saved. Always log out of any device you don’t own once you’re done playing<br><br>You can also log out of any unknown devices by using Roblox’s “Secure Sign Out” feature, which logs you out of all devices you’re logged in to other than the one that you’re currently using. To do this, follow the following steps:
            <ul>
                <li><p>Go to your Roblox account settings via the gear in the top-right corner in a browser, or tap the three dots on your mobile app and then tap the ‘Settings’ button</p></li>
                <li><p>Select the ‘Security’ tab, then tap the ‘sign out’ button in the ‘Secure Sign Out’ section</p></li>
            </ul>
            Use this feature often to ensure that you're only logged into the devices you own and regularly use.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h1>Avoid suspicious requests</h1>
        <p>If someone tells you something that seems too good to be true, whether on social media or in-game, it’s most likely a scam intended to steal your information or gain access to your account. If someone promises you Robux, items, or real-world money in exchange for your password or as a reward for a seemingly easy task, you should block their account and report them on Roblox if possible<br><br>GamingLightFam staff will never ask you to join a private server or log in to your account on a different website. If you win an official competition held by GamingLightFam, you will receive your items directly in your inventory</p>
        <br><br>
        <h1>Know what to look out for</h1>
        <p>Hackers commonly use phishing sites to steal information. These sites are designed to look exactly like official company websites and ask victims to enter sensitive information such as their passwords and credit card details<br><br><br>Always log in to the <a href="http://www.roblox.com/login">official Roblox page</a> to avoid having your information stolen<br><br><br><br>To contact Roblox Support to get proof of an account hack, please visit their Support Form <a href="https://www.roblox.com/support">here.</a></p>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">Proof of Hack?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>If you have contacted our team to ask for a return of your hacked items, we will need to see enough evidence that your account was hacked and has been secured. This will help you figure out what you should have prepared before opening a ticket with our Support team. We can only help your account and return the items if you provide this proof. We will only return items to a secured account as this lessens the risk of being hacked again.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h1>New Device Log-in Location Detected</h1>
            <br><p>You will first be asked for a screenshot of the New Device Log-in Location Detected" email, which looks like this:</p>
            <img class="faq-image" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/153016933187/original/QC0o-jMWUVyC1zV2lZihTldJqebrQcdg4Q.png?1720523956">
            <p>This email alert means Roblox has identified suspicious log-in activity and helps us affirm that your account may have been hacked. This is not all the proof we need, but it does accompany it. We cannot solely take this as evidence, as this email can be triggered easily.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h1>Account Restoral</h1>
            <p>Afterwards, we will request evidence that Roblox has restored your account after the hack, and thus protecting it from further occurrences.
                <br><br>
                You can do this by contacting Roblox <a href="https://www.roblox.com/support" target="_blank">here</a> and informing them that your account was hacked. You do not need to tell them you are missing gamepass items, as they may redirect you back to us and not assist. They can only assist with restoring hacked accounts, so you only need to let them know that your account was compromised and you would like it to be restored and secured
            </p>
            <img class="faq-image" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/153016933184/original/HjozWhHUPF8yPq5z1IzUhVKHiIUK8XLweQ.png?1720523955">
            <p>You can include additional information such as how and when you were hacked, whether you lost any Roblox limiteds or Robux, and whether any of your settings were changed, such as your PIN and email.
                <br><br>
                You should do this even if there is nothing you think there is to restore, as this still confirms on our end that your account was hacked and has now been secured. The account restoral email we're after looks like this:
            </p>
            <img class="faq-image" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/153016933186/original/iUMyrCXEV4DvYGWPCAIH1UkE8OxutmEq2g.png?1720523956">
            <h1>I can still log in to my account; please let me know why I should contact Roblox for a restoral.</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Regardless of whether you can still access your account, you should still contact Roblox and get it protected.<br><br>We need to see proof from a named Roblox agent that they have restored your account so that we can be certain that it is secure and that the hacker has no other entry points into it. We cannot proceed with your request until we receive this. Not every hacker will change your password, as they find other routes of entry which need to be eliminated<br><br>In addition, due to Roblox Privacy rules, we here at Uplift Games do not have access to the location and login data necessary to determine whether an account is hacked. As such, this Roblox Support email is used as proof since Roblox will only provide this restoration service in the event they detect an account hack within their system when you open a ticket.</p>
